# Improvement of Noise Reduction of Knee Joint Vibroarthrographic(VAG) Signals By Analyzing Different Filtering Methods
Vibro arthro graphy (VAG) is the recording of vibrations or acoustic signals from the human knee joint during active movement of the leg and can be used as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect articular cartilage degeneration. By analyzing different IIR filtering methods, we reduce the noise in practical scenarios. This was done as a part of digital filter design course work. The MATLAB files for improving the signal and the Project Presentation are provided in this repository.
