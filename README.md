# Improvement of Noise Reduction of Knee Joint Vibroarthrographic(VAG) Signals By Analyzing Different Filtering Methods
Vibro arthro graphy (VAG) is the recording of vibrations or acoustic signals from the human knee joint during active movement of the leg and can be used as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect articular cartilage degeneration. By analyzing different IIR filtering methods, we reduce the noise in practical scenarios. The MATLAB codes and the Project Presentation is provided.
